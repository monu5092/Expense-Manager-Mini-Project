The organization requires an Expense Manager Application to track employee income and expenses. Users can input their income and expenses, categorizing them into various types (e.g., Bonus, Salary, Consultancy for income, and Food, Education, Bills, Travel, and Miscellaneous for expenses). The application will be developed using Spring Boot, Hibernate, and MySQL, enabling straightforward expense tracking through CRUD operations.
